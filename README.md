## 🧰 About Me

I'm an enthusiastic Full-Stack & Web3 Developer with a growing focus on blockchain technologies. I specialize in:

- Building modern web applications with React and TypeScript
- Developing robust backend systems with Node.js and PHP/Laravel
- Learning and creating decentralized applications (dApps) using Solidity, Web3.js, and Ethereum
- Exploring DeFi protocols and blockchain architectures

I am passionate about bridging traditional web development with emerging Web3 technologies and continually expanding my knowledge in this exciting space.
